<p>Before we study the basic building blocks of the C programming language, let us look at a bare minimum C program structure so that we can take it as a reference in the upcoming chapters.</p>
<h2>Hello World Example</h2>
<p>A C program basically consists of the following parts &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Preprocessor Commands</li>
<li>Functions</li>
<li>Variables</li>
<li>Statements &amp; Expressions</li>
<li>Comments</li>
</ul>
<p>Let us look at a simple code that would print the words "Hello World" &minus;</p>
<div class="demo-view">
<a href="http://tpcg.io/3Ty4QP" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="demo"><i class="fa-external-link"></i> Live Demo</a>
</div>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
   /* my first program in C */
   printf("Hello, World! \n");
   
   return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>Let us take a look at the various parts of the above program &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The first line of the program <i>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</i> is a preprocessor command, which tells a C compiler to include stdio.h file before going to actual compilation.</p></li>
<li><p>The next line <i>int main()</i> is the main function where the program execution begins.</p></li>
<li><p>The next line /*...*/ will be ignored by the compiler and it has been put to add additional comments in the program. So such lines are called comments in the program.</p></li>
<li><p>The next line <i>printf(...)</i> is another function available in C which causes the message "Hello, World!" to be displayed on the screen.</p></li>
<li><p>The next line <b>return 0;</b> terminates the main() function and returns the value 0.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Compile and Execute C Program</h2>
<p>Let us see how to save the source code in a file, and how to compile and run it. Following are the simple steps &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Open a text editor and add the above-mentioned code.</p></li>
<li><p>Save the file as <i>hello.c</i></p></li>
<li><p>Open a command prompt and go to the directory where you have saved the file.</p></li>
<li><p>Type <i>gcc hello.c</i> and press enter to compile your code.</p></li>
<li><p>If there are no errors in your code, the command prompt will take you to the next line and would generate <i>a.out</i> executable file.</p></li>
<li><p>Now, type <i>a.out</i> to execute your program.</p></li>	
<li><p>You will see the output <i>"Hello World"</i> printed on the screen.</p></li>
</ul>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ gcc hello.c
$ ./a.out
Hello, World!
</pre>
<p>Make sure the gcc compiler is in your path and that you are running it in the directory containing the source file hello.c.</p>
