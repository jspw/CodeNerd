  </div>
  
  <p><strong>Breadth-First Search</strong> with its complement <a href="./dfs.html">Depth-First Search</a> are two popular methods of
  searching in the graph.
  They are building blocks for many other more special algorithms. At the same time each of them may be implemented in
  several different ways.</p>
  
  <p>The words <strong>Breadth-First</strong> in the name reflect the manner of search - from any vertex we are trying to investigate all
  neighbors as soon as possible. Because of this the search process looks as following:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>at first we visit the initial node itself - let us call it <code>level 0</code>;</li>
  <li>then we visit all nodes immediately reachable from the initial node - let us call them <code>level 1</code>;</li>
  <li>on the next step we reach all nodes immediately reachable from level 1 and call them <code>level 2</code>.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>And so on with the general rule that at level <code>K+1</code> we visit all neighbors of all nodes of level <code>K</code>, of course except
  ones already visited on previous steps. At the picture above initial node is <code>A</code>, while the first level consists of
  <code>B</code>, <code>C</code>, and <code>D</code> - and the second contains remaining <code>E</code>, <code>F</code> and <code>G</code>.</p>
  
  <p>The manner in which the algorithm visits vertices resembles the spreading of the wave when it floods the shore. Due to
  this fact particular implementation of the <strong>BFS</strong> on a rectangular grid is sometimes called <strong>Wave Algorithm</strong> - see
  the following picture to decide whether this name is correct:</p>

  <h3>Typical application</h3>
  
  <p>If the graph is connected, <strong>BFS</strong> will visit all of its nodes. If for each node we will remember where we got to it
  from - then the resulting set of edges will represent a <strong>tree</strong> connecting all nodes (so-called <strong>spanning tree</strong>).</p>
  
  <p>The tree built by <strong>BFS</strong> at the same time represents the shortests paths from initial vertex to any other (for the
  graph with the edges of equal weights - otherwise more special algorithm, like <a href="./dijkstra-in-the-network">Dijkstra</a>
  should be used).</p>
  
  <p>The puzzle Word Ladders gives an example of a problem when <strong>BFS</strong> is most suitable.</p>
  
  <p>Other popular usage is for discovering if the graph is connected or consists of several izolated parts. It also allows
  to mark which vertex belongs to which part. However this task could be by <strong>DFS</strong> also.</p>
  
  <h3>Algorithm implementation</h3>
  
  <p>Usually we prefer to use a <strong>Queue</strong> to keep the track of the nodes which we are going to visit soon.
  This data structure provides two operations, let us call them <code>add</code> and <code>remove</code> for putting new elements to it and
  fetching them later. The core property is that elements are removed in the same order in which they were stored - this
  is often called <code>FIFO</code>, i.e. <strong>first in, first out</strong>. For example if you add elements to the end of the list and remove
  them from the beginning - it will work as a queue.</p>
  
  <p>We also need some way to mark vertices as <code>seen</code> - it could be array of flags or set to which we will add ids of vertices
  or something like this.</p>
  
  <p>That's how algorithm works:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>We add the initial node to <code>queue</code> and mark it as <code>seen</code>.</li>
  <li>Remove the next element from the <code>queue</code> and call it <code>current</code>.</li>
  <li>Get all neighbors of the <code>current</code> node which are not yet marked as <code>seen</code>.</li>
  <li>Store all these neighbors into the <code>queue</code> and mark them all as <code>seen</code>.</li>
  <li>Repeat from the step <code>2</code> until the <code>queue</code> becomes empty.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>Usually we perform some additional actions along with these core steps. For example:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>after fetching each vertex from the <code>queue</code> we may print its name out - this will give us a list of the vertices
  of the graph (or its connected component) in the order of visiting by <strong>BFS</strong>;</li>
  <li>if using hashtable (aka dictionary) or array for <code>seen</code> we can store here not only the fact that the node was seen,
  but also the id of the vertex from which it was seen - as the result the hashtable will describe the tree of
  the shortest paths at the end;</li>
  <li>distance to the given vertex from the initial one could be stored in a separate array or hashtable.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>You also can read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search">wikipedia article</a> to get more clear idea.</p>

  <h3>Problem statement</h3>

<p>You are given an undirected and unweighted graph with vertices identifided by integers.
The goal is to run <strong>BFS</strong> over it as described above, <strong>starting from the node <code>0</code></strong>.</p>

<p>As output you should produce the <code>seen</code> array which shows where each vertex was visited from.</p>

<p>To avoid ambiguosity please at the step <code>3</code> sort all fetched neighbors in order of increasing their id numbers.</p>

<p><strong>Input data</strong> will contain the amount of nodes <code>N</code> and the amount of edges <code>M</code>.<br />
Then <code>M</code> lines will follow each containing ids of two nodes connected by an edge. Node ids are integers between <code>0</code> and <code>N-1</code>.<br />
<strong>Answer</strong> should contain the <code>seen</code> array as described above. It should have <code>-1</code> for the initial node.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>input data:
7 10
0 1
2 0
0 3
1 4
4 3
2 3
5 2
6 3
4 6
6 5

answer:
-1 0 0 0 1 2 3
